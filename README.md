**Logistical**
* What hours will you be available to communicate?
    * Whatever is reasonable, sleep hours off the table (11pm onward).
* What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
    * Slack
* How often will you take breaks?
    *  As needed.

**Cooperative**
* Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
    * Daniel: front-end
    * Jon: backend

* How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
    * We're implementing our weakness in the lab, and we'll consult each other if struggling.

* In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
    * Daniel: Handling errors
    * Jon: Undersanding css at a deep fundamental level.

* Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
    * Standup, delegate, check-ins at milestones. Daily.

**Conflict Resolution**

* What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
    * Call it out, and discuss.

* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
    * Call it out, and discuss.

* How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
    * Walking through the code in question to understand what is going on.
